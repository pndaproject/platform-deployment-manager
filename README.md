# Design #

The Deployment Manager is a service that manages package deployment and application creation for a single PNDA cluster.

- It implements the Packages, Applications, Repository and EnvironmentEndpoints API used by operators.
- It parses and validates basic package structure.
- It interacts with a Repository and a Registrar to determine available & record currently deployed packages and applications.
- It includes a number of component specific Creator implementations that carry out the concrete steps necessary to set up different parts of the Core Platform.
- It is easily extensible to support additional component types and repository types.

The design consists of a main class that implements the APIs and coordinates between a Repository, a Registrar and an Application Creator that dynamically loads a number of component specific Creator classes as required by a particular package.

HTTP and Python bindings are provided for these APIs.

## Connecting

By default, the Deployment Manager is installed on `edge` node o. In order to access it go to: http://[cluster-name]-cdh-edge:5000

## Repository ##

Packages are made available via a repository. The Deployment Manager is configured with a client of this repository at instantiation time. The reference repository is implemented as a thin wrapper over an Openstack Swift container.

## Registrar ##

The details of package deployments for a given service instance are recorded by a registrar. The registrar stores information in HBase in the platform_packages and platform_applications tables.

## Application Creator ##

The Application Creator handles the creation and control of applications on behalf of the Deployment Manager. It implements business logic that is common to all components and delegates to a component specific Creator as required by a particular package. Creator subclasses are dynamically loaded as needed by the Application Creator.

## Creator ##

Each component type is associated with a subclass of Creator. Each Creator implements the specific steps necessary to perform the following functions: 

### Validation ###

Each component type has a specific structure. Each Creator implements a validation function that checks that structure. All components are validated before the package is deployed. If any validation function fails, the package is deemed “bad” and package deployment fails. This provides an opportunity to catch simple package construction problems early in the deployment process.

### Application creation ###

Each component type has specific creation requirements and resource dependencies. Each Creator implements the process required to create components of a given type and returns “application_data”. The Deployment Manager aggregates the application data generated by the process of creating each of the components in the package, then persists an association between this and the package deployment using a Registrar.

### Application control ###

Applications may be paused and restarted. This leaves all the installed components in-place and temporarily stops the running processes associated with those components.

### Undeployment ###

Each Creator implements a specific set of steps to uninstall components of its associated type. The Creator is passed the application data associated with the package and component and uses this to execute those steps.


# Requirements

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

# Building

To build the Deployment Manager, change to the `api` directory, which contains the `pom.xml` file. Type `mvn clean package` on the command line. Once the build is successful, the built package will be placed in the `target` folder.
